results for transporter
results for sqair

results for 3d flow

make a plot of results for flow, sqair, transporter, in one of the datasets.

visualize diffs without multiplying by occ; just mult by occrel
> ok looks fine but this is worse

ablations:
> lower resolution lowers perf
> featdiff lowers perf
> higher resolution improves perf
