DONE

get carla_ego mode going, by copying from neural_3d_mapping

play with hyps to speed it up

get plots that prove things are working in carla

get kitti_ego mode going

write new kodo data, with longer trajs

add basic test mode

add proper part loading

add kodo to consec set

make long-seq testing/plotting within tb

add quantitative measurement for test: endpoint error

get synth motion on train iters

set up param-free egonet

make single-scale soft argmax

make even longer npzs; maybe 500 frames
> some loading problem
> try 100 frames
>> ok

shift the param-free egonet into matchnet.py

eliminate the phantom points around 0,0,0

add a second iteration (at test time)
> i think this is only necessary if we start oob; since the model is unaware of accumulated error here, i think it does not make sense (yet)

make a map
> chain pointclouds together with the estimated egomotion, and re-vox and re-feat
> aggregate everything into the camI sys
> make a good vis of this
>> _e and _g
>> and _diff

add a coarse/wide scale, to help make use of the agg
> ok but how do i combine this? maybe estimate coarse, then use this as ans, then estimate wide

get comparable outputs from orbslam
> i can use the outputs from seqs 09 and 10, for the first 100 frames
> to get more, i need to run orbslam2 myself, which i do not have time for today


DOING

get bev epe


SOON

add cc with other rotation directions

use a visibility-aware median, instead of just everything

experiment cleanly with:
> relu
> normalization
> two steps
> resolution

use resnet and take crops into account

add custom small-npz loading strategy for test time (ignoring the data loader)

use sparse-invar arch

LATER

make plot/table for katerina

read orbslam

install orbslam and get its outputs
